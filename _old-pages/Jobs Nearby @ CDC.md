<p>“Jobs Near Me @ Central” Programme aims to provide Central Singapore District
residents with local job opportunities that are near their homes and suit
their needs (e.g. caregiving duties / home-based). Residents can also build
capabilities and relevant skill sets to take on new jobs seamlessly and
achieve an adequate means of livelihood.</p>
<p>Employers within Central Singapore District can leverage on this platform
to be matched with suitable candidates living nearby to fill their vacancies.
The end in mind is to create a network that is self-sustaining in the long
run and useful for both residents and employers in meeting their needs.</p>
<p><strong>Why the need for Local Jobs?</strong>
</p>
<p>Residents (Job Seekers) may not be able to find jobs that are near their
homes / suit their needs (e.g. caregiving / home-based). Employers (Local
Jobs) want to look for staff who are living nearby to fill their vacancies
due to manpower shortage. Existing agencies focuses on traditional job
matching (not Local Jobs).</p>
<p>Through the initiative, Central SG CDC hopes to facilitate job seekers
to secure more stable, steady and regular placement opportunities with
employers that are near them. This way, residents will be able to maintain
an adequate means of livelihood.</p>
