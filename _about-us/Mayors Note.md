Dear residents,

Greetings from Central Singapore! My name is Denise Phua, and I am honoured to serve you as Central Singapore District’s Mayor.

Since the return of the Social and Employment Assistance functions to the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) in 2013, the CDC’s role has undergone a big change from what people used to associate us with.

Our key mission still remains – to Aggregate needs and resources, Build capabilities and capacities, and Connect the community.

At Central Singapore, we will _**enhance**_ our mission by moving in to meet ground needs and offer assistance through other localised initiatives. We call this “Assistance PLUS”. Community programmes under Assistance PLUS will look at plugging gaps or emerging needs for the lower-income, and for those who fall marginally out of the lower-income bracket.

We will continue to reach out to all residents, not just the lower income, by focusing on broader communities and causes. These include **_four key communities_** : Children, Youths, Adults and Seniors; and **_four key causes_**: Arts & Culture, Environment, Healthy Lifestyle, and Special Needs.

We also want Central Singapore to be known as a **Do-Good District** – to help those doing poorly to DO WELL, to enable those doing well to DO BETTER, encourage everyone to DO GOOD, and DO IT TOGETHER.

Beyond this, the CDC will value-add to the community as a whole through three key areas: developing and running district-level initiatives, creating and distributing sustainable service packages, and curating and supporting meaningful community projects.

We welcome individuals, groups, corporate and community stakeholders to join us in making Central Singapore a Do-Good District!

Yours sincerely,  
Denise Phua  
Mayor, Central Singapore District
