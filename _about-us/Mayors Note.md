<p>Dear residents,</p>
<p>Greetings from Central Singapore! My name is Denise Phua, and I am honoured
to serve you as Central Singapore District’s Mayor.</p>
<p>Since the return of the Social and Employment Assistance functions to
the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and the Singapore Workforce
Development Agency (WDA) in 2013, the CDC’s role has undergone a big change
from what people used to associate us with.</p>
<p>Our key mission still remains – to Aggregate needs and resources, Build
capabilities and capacities, and Connect the community.</p>
<p>At Central Singapore, we will&nbsp;<strong><em>enhance</em></strong>&nbsp;our
mission by moving in to meet ground needs and offer assistance through
other localised initiatives. We call this “Assistance PLUS”. Community
programmes under Assistance PLUS will look at plugging gaps or emerging
needs for the lower-income, and for those who fall marginally out of the
lower-income bracket.</p>
<p>We will continue to reach out to all residents, not just the lower income,
by focusing on broader communities and causes. These include<strong><em> key communities</em></strong>:
Children, Youths, Adults and Seniors; and&nbsp;<strong><em>key causes</em></strong>:
Arts &amp; Culture, Environment, Healthy Lifestyle, and Special Needs.</p>
<p>We also want Central Singapore to be known as a&nbsp;<strong>Do-Good District</strong>&nbsp;–
to help those doing poorly to DO WELL, to enable those doing well to DO
BETTER, encourage everyone to DO GOOD, and DO IT TOGETHER.</p>
<p>Beyond this, the CDC will value-add to the community as a whole through
three key areas: developing and running district-level initiatives, creating
and distributing sustainable service packages, and curating and supporting
meaningful community projects.</p>
<p>We welcome individuals, groups, corporate and community stakeholders to
join us in making Central Singapore a Do-Good District!</p>
