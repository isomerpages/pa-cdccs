<p>Central Singapore Community Development Council (CDC)’s mission is to
Aggregate resources from the CDC's networks to meet community needs, Build
capabilities and capacities in partners and networks, and Connect communities
to expand networks and drive community programmes. The CDC serves close
to one million residents living in the Central Singapore District, and
envisions itself as a Do-Good District, with a focus on helping residents
live The Better Life.</p>
<p>The CDC offers a suite of 52 ongoing programmes spanning across five focus
areas towards The Better Life: Physical Wellness &amp; Sustainability,
Financial &amp; Social Wellness, Socio-Emotional Wellness &amp; Inclusiveness,
Service To Others (Volunteerism &amp; Giving), and Lifelong Learning (SkillsFuture).</p>
<p>Aside from meeting ground needs through localised initiatives, the CDC
also value-adds to the community as a whole by developing district-level
initiatives, creating sustainable programmes, as well as supporting meaningful
community projects. Working with a variety of partners such as schools,
voluntary welfare organisations and the grassroots, the CDC aggregates
and connects various needs/resources for a more holistic approach to community
building.</p>
