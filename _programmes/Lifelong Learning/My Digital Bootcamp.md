<p>My Digital Bootcamp is an experiential and hands-on day camp that equips
children with digital- making skills and allows children to understand
the current digital landscape.</p>
<p>In the current digital landscape, children build strong digital literacy
and computational thinking skills through various learning opportunities.
These include enrichment classes and camps provided for by the school,
and holiday programmes which the parents/guardians enroll the child in.</p>
<p>My Digital Bootcamp provides children from disadvantaged backgrounds with
access to similar digital learning opportunities.</p>
<p>This is one of the initiatives under Central Singapore CDCâ€™s SkillsFuture
Junior movement. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds are equipped with
relevant 21 st century skills. This movement complements the long-term
national SkillsFuture efforts: to give Singaporeans from all walks of life
the opportunity to develop skills relevant to the future.</p>
