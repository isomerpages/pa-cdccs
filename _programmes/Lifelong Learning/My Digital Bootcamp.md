**WHAT IS MY DIGITAL BOOTCAMP (SEASON 3) AND HOW IS IT CONDUCTED?**

My Digital Bootcamp is an experiential and hands-on day camp that equips children with digital-
making skills and allows children to understand the current digital landscape.

In the current digital landscape, children build strong digital literacy and computational thinking skills
through various learning opportunities. These include enrichment classes and camps provided for by
the school, and holiday programmes which the parents/guardians enroll the child in.

My Digital Bootcamp provides children from disadvantaged backgrounds with access to similar
digital learning opportunities.

This is one of the initiatives under Central Singapore CDC’s SkillsFuture Junior movement. Children
from disadvantaged backgrounds are equipped with relevant 21 st century skills. This movement
complements the long-term national SkillsFuture efforts: to give Singaporeans from all walks of life the
opportunity to develop skills relevant to the future.
