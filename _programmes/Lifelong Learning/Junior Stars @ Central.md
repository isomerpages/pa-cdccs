<p>‘Junior Stars' by Central Singapore CDC aims to narrow the gap by providing
equal learning opportunities for children from lower-income families in
the Central Singapore district. We will also expose children aged 7 to
12 to future-ready skillsets for jobs of the future, helping them achieve
a better life</p>
<p>The new 'Junior Stars @ Central' offers a "Plug-and-Play" model, providing
flexibility for community partners to come on board at any time. The new
format offers an expanded program menu for partners, focusing on three
key areas: personal well-being, personal effectiveness, and future-ready
topics.</p>
<p>Under the Programme Menu, we offer a range of workshops under 1) Self-Mastery
and 2) Skills for the Future series</p>
