<p>Junior Stars Nurture is a 40-week community programme for disadvantaged
children aged 7 to 12. The programme comprises two core modules – Communications
(20 weeks) and Problem-Solving (20 weeks).</p>
<p>The activity-based curriculum is designed to be interactive, engaging
and child-centric. With targeted lesson plans for each Primary Level, the
programme aims to complement existing educational efforts and help children
strengthen their academic foundation while developing essential skills
that will equip them for the future.</p>
<p>Nurture supports and complements the efforts of MOE schools and self-help
groups by helping children to:</p>
