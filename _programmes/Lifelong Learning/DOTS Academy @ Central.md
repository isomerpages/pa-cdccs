<p><strong>DOTS Academy @ Central</strong> is a new initiative by Central
Singapore CDC aimed at providing access, exposure, and coaching for youths
based in Central to become <strong>Confident, Curious, and Caring</strong>.</p>
<p>Recognising that a fulfilling life is woven from a richly interconnected
series of opportunities, exposures, and connections, akin to a constellation
of "dots", Central Singapore CDC is dedicated to enriching the lives of
youths based in Central.</p>
<p>This is achieved through the provision of valuable learning opportunities,</p>
<p>meaningful exposures, and connections, thereby leveling the playing field
for youths who lack access to these vital resources.</p>
<p>These learning opportunities, exposures, and connections, symbolically
referred to as "DOTS", will be consolidated and offered under the ‘DOTS
Academy @ Central’ initiative.</p>
<p>Over 2 years, ALL youths (aged 13 to 35 years old) will experience Core
&amp; Elective DOTS:</p>
<p>• <strong>Core “DOTS”</strong> are fundamental experiences focusing mainly
on self-awareness and discovery, such as career exploration workshops,
career tasters &amp; deep dives.</p>
<p>• <strong>Elective “DOTS”</strong> are interest-based experiences such as
concerts, learning journeys, and niche interest activities.</p>
<p>Youths will graduate if they complete either<strong> 3 Cores and 2 Electives or 4 Cores.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>If you’re a community, grassroots organisations, or schools serving youths and are based in Central Singapore district, reach out to us to nominate your youths for this initiative.</strong>
