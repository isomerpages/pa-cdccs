**What is it?**  
The 'Temasek Trust-CDC Lifelong Learning Enabling Fund' is a S$4 million community fund set up to support persons with disabilities in acquiring relevant vocational and independent living skills and emerge stronger from the pandemic.  
  
This Fund is set up by Temasek Trust and the five Community Development Councils (CDCs), and is administered by SG Enable. Each eligible adult with disability can apply for up to S$1,000 to defray course-related fees and/or learning support devices and services.  
  
Approved funding will be provided on a reimbursement basis, i.e., claims with receipts.
