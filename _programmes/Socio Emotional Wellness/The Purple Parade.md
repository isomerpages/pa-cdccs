<p>The Purple Parade is Singaporeâ€™s largest annual gathering that seeks to
advocate the inclusion and celebrates the abilities of People with Disabilities
(PWDs). The Parade comprises five key components:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Campaign</strong>: A pre-event campaign at locations such as schools,
shopping malls and train cabins, to create awareness of the Parade and
the movement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Carnival</strong>: A carnival comprising booths by participating
organisations from the public and private sectors, to raise funds for organisations
in the Disability sector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contingent</strong>: A march-past of various contingent groups
from the public and private sector, decked out in unique costumes and props,
to show their support for the movement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Concert</strong>: An all-inclusive concert showcasing the talents
of performers with and without Disabilities. Performing groups include
representatives from various organisations in the Disability sector, as
well as the 3Ps (People, Public, Private).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conversations:</strong>&nbsp;A human library for people to gain
a deeper understanding of the Disability community through sharing of personal
stories.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first Purple Parade was held at Hong Lim Park in 2013. The Parade
consists of participating groups and individuals, representing a community
of like-minded organisations such as Voluntary Welfare Organisations, schools,
social enterprises, government agencies and corporations. They are all
united by a common belief that People with Disabilities have abilities
and are able to contribute to society.</p>
<p>We celebrated our 12th Anniversary in 2024! For this momentous milestone,
over 10,000 participants took part in the massive event, with 200 organisations
and 5000 contingent paraders! Relive the magic of our 12th Anniversary
