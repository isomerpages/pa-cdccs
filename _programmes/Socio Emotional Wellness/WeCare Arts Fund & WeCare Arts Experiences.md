#### **WeCare Arts Fund**

The WeCare Arts Fund is a grant scheme by the National Arts Council (NAC) in partnership with the People’s Association. The fund aims to support Social Service Agencies (SSAs) in the 5 districts in Singapore through the Community Development Councils to broaden access for SSAs in bringing arts to the community and enhance well-being of beneficiaries.

Artists/art groups will work directly with the SSA to engage their beneficiaries through the performing, visual, literary or multi-disciplinary art-forms through:

*   Workshops (recommendation of 6-8 sessions)
*   Co-creation of performances and exhibitions, where beneficiaries go through the artistic process with the artist/group

Social service agencies may apply for WCAF through the [Our SG Grants portal](https://safe.menlosecurity.com/https:/oursggrants.gov.sg/).

#### **WeCare Arts Experiences**

WeCare Arts Experiences is a collaboration between the National Arts Council (NAC) and the five Community Development Councils (CDCs). It encourages beneficiaries from less privileged backgrounds to access ticketed arts and cultural experiences curated by the NAC and Singapore’s cultural institutions for free. Beneficiaries are also encouraged to attend with immediate family members, caregivers or befrienders, for the opportunity to bond over a shared arts experience and strengthen social ties. Social Service Agencies (SSAs), and community partners such as Grassroots Organisations (GROs) and Self-Help Group (SHGs) can apply for this scheme.

WeCare Arts Experiences supports ticket of up to $40 (excluding ticketing fees), transportation and light refreshments to facilitate the attendance of arts experiences for

*   beneficiaries who are recipients of SSA’s services and assistance;
*   beneficiaries who receive financial and social assistance support from community partners;
*   immediate family of beneficiaries; and
*   volunteers who accompany beneficiaries to the arts experiences.
