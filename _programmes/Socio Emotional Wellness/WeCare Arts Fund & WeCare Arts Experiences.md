The WeCare Arts Fund is a grant scheme by the National Arts Council (NAC) in partnership with the People’s Association. The fund aims to support Social Service Agencies (SSAs) in the 5 districts in Singapore through the Community Development Councils to broaden access for SSAs in bringing arts to the community and enhance well-being of beneficiaries.

Artists/art groups will work directly with the SSA to engage their beneficiaries through the performing, visual, literary or multi-disciplinary art-forms through:

*   Workshops (recommendation of 6-8 sessions)
*   Co-creation of performances and exhibitions, where beneficiaries go through the artistic process with the artist/group

All projects and related costs under the above projects will be supported by the WeCare Arts Fund. For more information, you may contact us at [pa\_centralsingapore@pa.gov.sg](mailto:pa_centralsingapore@pa.gov.sg).
