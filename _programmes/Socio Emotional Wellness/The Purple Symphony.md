The Purple Symphony is an inclusive orchestra comprising talented musicians with and without disabilities. Its members play a range of Asian and Western instruments from five key musical sections: Strings (Plucked), Strings (Bow), Wind, Percussion and Choir.

As Singaporeâ€™s first all-inclusive orchestra, The Purple Symphony creates an opportunity for the inclusion of people who are different. It is a ready avenue for musicians to learn and share music with one another and their audiences, support inclusion, and celebrate and demonstrate their abilities and excellence they can achieve together.

The Purple Symphony debuted on 31 July 2015 at the Singapore Conference Hall with 83 pioneer members from various organisations.
