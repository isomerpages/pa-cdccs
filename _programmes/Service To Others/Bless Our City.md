The programme supports meaningful initiatives by **social service and community organisations** that benefit communities in need through **resource support**.

Through partnerships with social service and community organisations, the programme aims to give strength to their existing and/or upcoming work; bring attention to their causes; and ultimately promote a more collaborative and holistic social service ecosystem.

The first grant call for proposals focuses on five identified communities in need:

Ex-offenders,

Persons with mental health issues,

Persons with special needs,

Transient workers, and

Vulnerable families and individuals.

Local Family Service Centres (FSCs), NCSS-registered Social Service Organisations (SSOs), and Non-Profit Organisations (NPOs) that have been invited in the first grant call meet the following criteria:

The project benefits at least one of the five identified communities in need;

The project provides direct assistance and/or support in underserved areas; and

The programme partner is not a profit-making or asset-building entity i.e. not a social enterprise or a business.

A second grant call for proposals may open if there is sufficient grant for support after all invited organisations in the first grant call have responded and their applications have been reviewed.
