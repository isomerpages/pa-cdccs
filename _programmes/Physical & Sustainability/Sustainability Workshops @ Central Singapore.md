Sustainability Workshops @ Central Singapore encourages the act of upcycling, which is the conversion unwanted items into something useful. 

Our Sustainability Workshops aims to:
* Teach participants how to repurpose items into something useful in accordance to the ‘Lifestyle’ theme – upcycled products which are functional and practical to be used in one’s daily lifestyle.
* Raise awareness on the environmental consequences of waste and consumerism
* Encourage a zero-waste lifestyle
* Create better environmental value
