The programme is designed to provide one-off home refurbishment to support families with children staying in public rental flats within Central district. 

The makeover process includes:

*  Consultation between designers and families to co-create living spaces that suit their lifestyle and needs

*  Engagement of contractors, movers, and cleaners to declutter and renovate the homes

*  Provision of basic furnishings such as study tables, beds, and wardrobes

*  Sharing of home organising tips by professionals

**Volunteer with us!**  
Interested organisations may contact the CDC to help refurbish our familiesâ€™ homes.
