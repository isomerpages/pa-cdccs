<p>Non-profit organisations and community partners can request for used household
appliances and furniture for their needy clients; residents can also share
and donate their pre-loved items through the online portal (<a href="http://www.passiton.org.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.passiton.org.sg</a>).</p>
<p>How it works:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">

</li>
<li>
<p>Complete the donation form with details of the items you would like to
give away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide your contact details along with a brief description and photos
of the items for donation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indicate if you would like The Helping Hand to collect the items from
your home at a nominal fee, or if you would like to deliver the items to
the Social Service Agencies directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait for a response from the Social Service Agencies who are in need of
your donated items.</p>
</li>
</ol>
