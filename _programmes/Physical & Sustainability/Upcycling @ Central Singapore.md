Project Upcycle is one of the zero waste initiatives by Central Singapore CDC to create awareness and encourage the act of upcycling amongst residents. Conducted by experienced “upcyclers”, the programme brings hands-on upcycling workshops to the heartlands, schools, community events and spaces to encourage residents to repurpose used items into something new and useful.
