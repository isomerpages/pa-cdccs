The COVID-19 pandemic has affected many Singaporeans and heartland businesses alike.

King Omar Restaurant, who has been in operation for eight years, offers Indian-Muslim and Thai fusion food. Even with their unique cuisine, the stall was no exception to the impacts of the pandemic.

Owner, Mr Abu Bakar, shared that he has experienced his worst business downturn, but the ‘CDC Vouchers Scheme’ (first launched in 2020) came as a ray of hope that helped his business tremendously.  

Mr Bakar recounted, “this (CDC Vouchers) scheme came just in time to help the community and small heartland businesses like us. We are also honoured to be able to help lower-income families in need.”

The five Community Development Councils are heartened that the ‘CDC Vouchers Scheme’ was able to help Singaporean households with their daily expenses, as well as support local hawkers and heartland merchants.
