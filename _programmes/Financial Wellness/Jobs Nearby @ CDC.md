<p><a href="https://go.gov.sg/jobsnearbycdc" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Jobs Nearby @ CDC</a> aims
to provide Central Singapore District residents with local job opportunities
that are near their homes and suit their needs (e.g. caregiving duties
/ home-based). Residents can also build capabilities and relevant skill
sets to take on new jobs seamlessly and achieve an adequate means of livelihood.</p>
<p>Employers within Central Singapore District can leverage on this platform
to be matched with suitable candidates living nearby to fill their vacancies.
The end in mind is to create a network that is self-sustaining in the long
run and useful for both residents and employers in meeting their needs.</p>
<h3><strong>Why the need for Local Jobs?</strong></h3>
<p>This initiative aims to specifically address the demand for local jobs,
complementing the broader job matching efforts of existing agencies. Residents
(Job Seekers) often face challenges in finding employment opportunities
that are close to home and</p>
<p>suited to their personal circumstances (e.g., caregiving or home-based
roles). At the same time, employers are seeking staff who reside closer
to job locations to fill vacancies.</p>
