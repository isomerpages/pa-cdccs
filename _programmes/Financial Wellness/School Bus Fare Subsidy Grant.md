<p>In 2024 MOE has allowed School Bus operators to increase School Bus fares
by 13% to meet increasing costs of operations. This is above the 7% increase
in 2023</p>
<p>To support families who would be affected by this cost increase, Central
Singapore CDC has launched the <strong>School Bus Fare Subsidy Grant.</strong>
</p>
<p>This grant is aimed at Primary and Special Education School students from
families with a household income of â‰¤ $3,400, living within the Central
Singapore district.</p>
<p>Eligible families may enjoy a one-off support of $200 to offset the increase
in fees.</p>
<p>Through this support we hope to provide some financial relief for affected
families, hopefully enabling them to better manage expenses for their children!</p>
<p>Applications are open until 31 OCTOBER 2O24, and can be made at the various
Community Centres in the Central Singapore District!</p>
<p>Do approach your nearest Community Centre for more information and to
apply!</p>
