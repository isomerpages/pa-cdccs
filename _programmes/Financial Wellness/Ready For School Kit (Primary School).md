The Ready for School Kit supports low-income families with school-going children, who face additional financial burden during the back-to-school season. These families have difficulties coping with the increase in expenditure and their children may return for the new school term without being fully equipped with the school necessities. With Ready for School Kit, we hope to help these children enjoy new school term like their peers and focus on their academic studies with lesser stress.

Each eligible primary school student will receive $120 worth of vouchers for school essentials.
