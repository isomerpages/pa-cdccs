CashUP Plus Programme targets residents who have fallen through the cracks and face financial difficulties and debts. Our programme aims to help low-income residents and constituents of Central Singapore District start a money-saving habit to break out of the poverty cycle.

The intention is to offer a coordinated support so that affected beneficiaries can be assisted timely and build up their knowledge on money management.
  
To date, 85 beneficiaries have benefitted from this programme.

_“The programme makes me be able to talk about my core issues, I don’t have any avenues to pour out my frustrations and this programme allows me to share my financial difficulties. I appreciate the debt relief fund amount through this programme, it also help me reduce my stress for a while and I get to learn new things.” - Mr Syed_

 
Residents may sign up for the programme via referrals from Social Service Offices (SSOs), Grassroots Organisations, or Central Singapore CDC.
