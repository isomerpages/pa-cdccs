Upcycling @ Central Singapore aims to encourage residents to move towards a ZERO-WASTE lifestyle by repurposing their unwanted items into useful products through the following programmes:

**Central Singapore Upcycling Contest**

Dear residents,

Thank you for your interest in the Central Singapore Upcycling Contest. We regret to inform you that the submission period for the contest has closed.

**Project Upcycle**

Project Upcycle is one of the zero waste initiatives by Central Singapore CDC to create awareness and encourage the act of upcycling amongst residents. Conducted by experienced “upcyclers”, the programme brings hands-on upcycling workshops to the heartlands, schools, community events and spaces to encourage residents to repurpose used items into something new and useful.
