**Central Singapore Market** brings together a community of partners to promote local businesses and social causes through the 3 components – **Healthy Lifestyle**, **Environment** and **Inclusivity**. Our market showcases locally grown, crafted offerings including upcycled artisanal products that advocate a healthy and environmentally conscious lifestyle. The special needs community will get to showcase their abilities through performances and product offerings, to promote the message of inclusivity.
