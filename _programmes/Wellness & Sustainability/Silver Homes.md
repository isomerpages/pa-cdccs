Silver Homes is a volunteer-driven initiative to create healthy, safe and clean living environments for underprivileged seniors. We hope to improve the mental and physical well-being of seniors through home improvement initiatives such as:

*   Spring cleaning
*   Painting
*   Pest treatment
*   Replacement of bedframes and mattress sets

**Volunteer with us!**  
Interested organisations or volunteer groups with at least 25 volunteers aged 16 and above may contact the CDC to help refurbish our seniors' homes.
