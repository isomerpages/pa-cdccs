Give and Take Market is a programme by Jalan Besar GRC and Central Singapore CDC to promote the spirit of giving and assist families in need. It aims to lighten the cost of living for lower-income families with children living in rental flats in Jalan Besar. 

The Markets are rotated on a monthly basis throughout the four divisions of Jalan Besar GRC. 

The Markets are designed to offer an element of choice. Beneficiaries can 'shop' at booths and pick from an array of essentials, such as household necessities, electrical appliances and even toys, to suit their needs. Many of these items are generously donated by sponsors spanning Retail, Food and Beverage, Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sectors. 

Organisations and individuals who wish to join the programme as givers and volunteers can approach Community Centres/Clubs within Jalan Besar GRC or Central Singapore CDC.
