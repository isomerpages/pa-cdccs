**Giraffes Singapore** is a **volunteer movement by Central Singapore CDC**. It encourages individuals to '**Stick Your Necks Out for the Common Good**'.  
  
In line with our mission to build a do-good district, the CDC works closely with a pool of committed 'Giraffe' volunteers to serve our communities in need. Our 'Giraffe' volunteers play a vital role in expanding our outreach to the vulnerable by contributing their skills, expertise, and networks.
