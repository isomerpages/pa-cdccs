The Purple Symphony is an inclusive orchestra comprising talented musicians with and without disabilities. Its members play a range of Asian and Western instruments from five key musical sections: Strings (Plucked), Strings (Bow), Wind, Percussion and Choir.

As Singapore’s first all-inclusive orchestra, The Purple Symphony creates an opportunity for the inclusion of people who are different. It is a ready avenue for musicians to learn and share music with one another and their audiences, support inclusion, and celebrate and demonstrate their abilities and excellence they can achieve together.
